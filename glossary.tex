\newacronym{gm}{GM}{Game Master. In the original DnD rulebooks, this individual was referred to as the \textit{Dungeon Master}. With the growing number of tabletop rpgs since the release of Dnd 1e, a popular generic term is \textit{Game Master}. However, this term is considered problematic by some; proposed alternative titles include \textit{Storyteller}, \textit{Moderator}, and \textit{Host}, among others.}
